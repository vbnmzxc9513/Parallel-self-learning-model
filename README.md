# Parallel-self-learning-model

This is a project of implement machine learning system which can self-learning by collecting data from google using crawler. This system can be splited in three major stage, craller stage, feature extraction stage and SVM modeling stage. Each of stage take a long time, so we using lots of parallel method to speed up them. Finally, we get approximately 85 times speed up over the serial program.
